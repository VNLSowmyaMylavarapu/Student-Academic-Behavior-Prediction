Student Academic Behavior Prediction using Big Data and Attention Models
📊 Big Data-Driven Attention Models in Student Academic Behavior Prediction

This project presents a Big Data-driven predictive analytics framework integrating machine learning and attention-based neural networks to analyze student academic and behavioral data and accurately predict academic performance and scholarship eligibility.

The system leverages:

Big Data analytics

Machine learning models

Attention-based neural networks

Feature engineering techniques

Behavioral clustering and segmentation

Hybrid ensemble learning

These techniques uncover hidden patterns in student attention and behavior that significantly influence academic outcomes.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional student performance prediction systems rely mainly on demographic or historical academic data, which often lack predictive accuracy and behavioral insights.

This project introduces a hybrid predictive framework combining Random Forest and Attention-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to improve prediction accuracy using attention-driven behavioral features.

The framework analyzes key psychological attention metrics:

Attention Stability – Consistency in academic focus

Attention Span – Duration of sustained academic engagement

Attention Shifting – Frequency of switching between activities

Attention Distribution – Allocation of attention across academic and non-academic tasks

These metrics provide deeper insight into student learning behavior and enable accurate academic performance prediction.
