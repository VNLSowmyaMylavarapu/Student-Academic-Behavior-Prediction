# Student-Academic-Behavior-Prediction\

📊 Big Data-Driven Attention Models in Student Academic Behavior Prediction
This project presents a Big Data-driven predictive analytics framework integrating machine learning and attention-based neural networks designed to analyze student academic and behavioral data to accurately predict academic performance and scholarship eligibility. The system leverages Big Data analytics, feature engineering, clustering, and hybrid ensemble learning to uncover patterns in student attention and behavior that influence academic outcomes.

🚀 Project Overview
Traditional student performance prediction models rely primarily on demographic or past academic data, which often lack interpretability and predictive accuracy. This project introduces a hybrid model combining Random Forest and Attention-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to improve prediction accuracy using attention-driven behavioral features.
The framework analyzes psychological attention metrics such as:
Attention Stability
Attention Span
Attention Shifting
Attention Distribution
These features are derived from student behavioral and academic activity data to better understand learning patterns and predict academic performance.
